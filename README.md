# Dotfiles. Again.

It was late 2016. My dotfiles had drifted far from their gitish home. The IT department had informed me it was time for a new laptop. It was time. The re-dotfile-gitting was upon us.

Goals for this go-round:

* works well for multiple development environments. I'm doing more work again on remote linux machines, but still have some local macishness happening. Per machine customization and platform awareness FTW.
* Tool that can ship with the dotfiles and not have local dependencies

This time I'm giving [homemaker](https://foosoft.net/projects/homemaker/) a shot.
[Alterant](https://github.com/autonomy/alterant) looks interesting as well, especially the encryption capability, but the documentation seems offline.

# How To

    ./install.sh

# Todo
