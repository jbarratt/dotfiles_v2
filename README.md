# Dotfiles. Again.

## Main dotfiles

Installed using dotbot. Just run:

./install

## Homebrew

```
    $ brew bundle # install everything in the Brewfile/upgrade if needed
    $ brew bundle --force dump # overwrite the Brewfile with currently installed stuff
    $ brew bundle cleanup # remove any formulae not currently installed
    $ brew bundle check # let you know the status of everything
```
